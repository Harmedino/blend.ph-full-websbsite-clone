            <p><strong>How do I know if it&#8217;s really from
                    BlendPH?</strong></p>
            <p>Here are the things to consider and to do if someone
                claims to be an employee of BlendPH:</p>
            <p>&#8211; BlendPH NEVER solicit fees from borrowers or
                lenders for their application. <br />&#8211; Confirm the
                identity of the person who claims to be an employee of
                BlendPH before coordinating.<br />&#8211; ALWAYS refer
                to the contact details below to have a secure
                transaction with BlendPH.<br />Please see the official
                contact details below:<br />Mobile:

                <p>When a scammer reaches you through social media, email,
                    postal mail, phone call, robocall, or SMS message,
                    report it.</p>
                <p><strong>How to avoid scammers?</strong></p>
                <p>• <strong>Spot the red flags.</strong> Scammers may use a
                    corporate brand or organization’s name and pretend to
                    represent one. If they dangle gifts, offer reduced fees,
                    or pressure you to make an upfront investment,
                    refuse.<br />• <strong>Do not take the bait.</strong>
                    Some scammers use bait, like fake tickets, to get your
                    money. Or prey on unsuspecting victims’ emotions, then
                    ask for fund transfer. Others state many people have
                    accepted their offer. Avoid giving personal
                    information/bank details.<br />• <strong>Do not be duped
                        by the sense of urgency they create.</strong>
                    Scammers may use tactics, like timing their move during
                    or after a tragedy or disaster. If the offer is too good
                    to be true, trust your instinct and steer clear!<br />•
                    <strong>Verify identities.</strong> Always recheck a
                    person’s name or company being dealt with. Is the
                    information being provided verifiable? Confirm claims by
                    directly calling the company mentioned.
                </p>
                <p><strong>How do I keep my account safe?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>NEVER comment your personal information ( maiden
                        name, date of birth) on social media
                        posts<br />-including email, Blend.PH account
                        details (Lender id, borrower id, email,
                        password)<br />(checkmark)Make sure the site is

                        and have a lock icon next to it.</li>
                    <li>Beware of phishing scams. Be suspicious of emails
                        and text messages <br />&#8211; refer to the contact
